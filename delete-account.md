# Delete Your RefLog Data

RefLog is **local-first** and does not currently require an account. All your match data is stored locally on your device, not in the cloud.

---

## How to Delete Your Local Data

### Option 1: Delete Individual Matches
Within the RefLog app:
1. Go to the match list in Ref Mode or Coach Mode
2. Swipe left on any match or long-press to select
3. Tap the delete button
4. Confirm deletion

### Option 2: Uninstall the App
To remove **all** RefLog data from your device:
1. Uninstall the RefLog app from your iOS or Android device
2. All local match data will be permanently deleted

**Important:** Once deleted, your local data cannot be recovered. Consider exporting important matches as PDFs or Excel files before deletion.

## Before You Delete

We recommend backing up any matches you want to keep:
1. Open the match in RefLog
2. Tap the export button
3. Save the PDF or Excel file to your device or cloud storage
4. Share it to your email, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

## Future Cloud Features

When we introduce optional cloud sync and collaboration features in the future:
- Accounts will be optional (local-only use will still be supported)
- Cloud account deletion will be available via in-app settings or by request
- We'll update this page with instructions for cloud account deletion
