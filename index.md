# RefLog — Log, review, and improve your refereeing.

RefLog is the modern match logbook built for rugby referees. With simple tools for recording and reviewing events, you can spend less time coding games and more time learning from them.  

Whether you’re just starting out or building experience at the community level, RefLog helps you:  
- **Log match events quickly** with clear timestamps.  
- **Review footage efficiently** by linking events to YouTube video.  
- **Add context with notes** so you don’t forget key details.  
- **Stay organized** with a clean timeline of your matches.  

> RefLog isn’t just about recording the game — it’s about making review simple, so you can keep improving every match.
