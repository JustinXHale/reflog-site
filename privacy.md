# Privacy Policy for RefLog

_Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}_

RefLog ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

---

## 1. Local-First, Privacy-First

RefLog is designed with your privacy in mind. **All your match data is stored locally on your device.** We do not collect, transmit, or store your match information, notes, or personal data on our servers.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

RefLog currently collects **minimal information**:

- **Device Information** (optional, for diagnostics):
  - Device model and operating system version
  - App version

- **Crash & Performance Data** (optional):
  - Crash logs to help us fix bugs
  - Diagnostics information for app stability

We **do not** currently collect:
- Account information (RefLog does not require login)
- Personal identifying information
- Usage analytics
- Match data or content you create

---

## 3. How We Use Information

The minimal diagnostic information we may collect is used solely to:

- Diagnose technical issues and crashes
- Improve app stability and performance
- Respond to support requests when you contact us

We **do not sell or rent** any information to third parties.

---

## 4. Data Storage

**Your match data is stored locally on your device** using encrypted local storage (Hive database). Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly:

- Export a PDF or Excel file and share it yourself
- Contact support and choose to share screenshots or details

We have no access to your local match data.

---

## 5. Future Features (Cloud Sync & Collaboration)

We are planning to introduce optional cloud features in future versions, including:

- Cloud backup and sync across devices
- Collaboration Mode (sharing matches with coaches)

When these features are released:
- They will be **optional** (you can continue using RefLog locally)
- We will update this privacy policy with details about cloud data handling
- User authentication and cloud storage will use secure services (likely Firebase or Supabase)

---

## 6. Third-Party Services

RefLog currently integrates:

- **Flutter framework** - Cross-platform mobile development (Google)
- **Firebase Core** - Crash reporting infrastructure (ready but not actively transmitting data)

These services may collect minimal diagnostic data in accordance with their privacy policies:
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

---

## 7. Security

We take appropriate measures to protect your data:

- **Local encryption** - Your match data is encrypted on your device
- **No cloud transmission** - Your data stays on your device unless you export it
- **Secure app distribution** - Downloaded via official App Store and Google Play

---

## 8. Your Control

You have full control over your data:

- **Delete anytime** - Uninstall the app to remove all local data
- **Export freely** - Export PDFs/Excel files and control who you share them with
- **No account required** - No login means no account to manage or delete

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as new features are added (especially cloud features). Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
