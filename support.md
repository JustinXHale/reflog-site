## Getting Started

### Built-In Tutorials
RefLog includes interactive walkthroughs for all screens. If you dismissed them, you can re-enable tutorials in the app settings.

### Common Questions

**How do I unlock Tech Zone mode?**
Tech Zone is a beta feature for advanced users. Tap the RefLog banner in the app drawer 7 times to unlock it. Once unlocked, you can toggle it on/off in settings.

**How do I export my match reports?**
After logging a match in Ref Mode or creating an observation in Coach Mode, tap the export button to generate a professional PDF. You can save it to your device or share it directly.

**Does RefLog work offline?**
Yes! RefLog is completely offline-capable. All your data is stored locally on your device. No internet connection required.

**How do I back up my data?**
Currently, all data is stored locally on your device. We recommend regularly exporting your matches as PDFs or Excel files for backup. Cloud sync is coming in a future update.

**Can I use RefLog for other sports?**
RefLog is currently rugby-specific, but we're open to expanding to other sports based on user demand. Let us know if you're interested!
